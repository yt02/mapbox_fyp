## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get Mapbox Access Tokens

1. Create a Mapbox account at [mapbox.com](https://www.mapbox.com/)
2. Navigate to your account dashboard and get your access token
3. For some features, you might also need a Mapbox Downloads token

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

1. Open the `assets/config.properties` file
2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Mapbox tokens:
   ```
   MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_access_token_here
   MAPBOX_DOWNLOADS_TOKEN=your_mapbox_downloads_token_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key_here
   ```

### 3. Firebase Setup

#### Firestore Security Rules

You need to set up Firestore security rules to allow authenticated users to read and write their own data. In your Firebase Console:

1. Go to Firestore Database
2. Click on "Rules" tab
3. Replace the default rules with:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read and write their own profile data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }

    // Allow users to query for usernames during registration/login
    match /users/{document} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null &&
                     resource.data.keys().hasAny(['username', 'email']);
    }
  }
}
```

4. Click "Publish" to apply the rules

### 4. Platform-Specific Setup

#### Android

1. Add the following permissions to your `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:
